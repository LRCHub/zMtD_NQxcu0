Love loves to love, love
To love, love, to love
Love loves to love, love
To love, love, to love

Some people live within the world
And some people live without it
Some people got to whisper their love
And some they got to shout it
One thing they have in common is
They all talk a lot about it
Everybody wants it or has it or holds it
But as for me I doubt it

Every tiger in the zoo must have a tiger too
And the keeper loves a lady who is dead
His majesty the king loves her majesty the queen
The blues come up all red
You love someone who loves someone else
And your heart it feels like lead
Everyone loves someone
But the universe knows exactly what
That's why I said

It really doesn't matter what the guy's like
If he's the kind to take hold of you
Everyone wins or loses at love
But love is never the loser
All you got to do is whisper the words
And everybody understands you
Love is an excuse for happiness or tears
Or anything that you know has you.
