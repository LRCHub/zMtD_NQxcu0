Take a look, you see I painted you a picture
It's black and white, except the blood's a little richer
Down in the corner where I gave it my signature
And then I titled it "This one's for the winter"
Check it out, you'll see it's just a big disaster

I'll dedicate it to the fact that it's so hard for you to dream
A million heartbeats all around you make it hard to sleep
It doesn't help you're freezing in
Your bed, your blankets aren't enough
All you want is someone there, and all you say is, "So what?"

Love love, kiss kiss, blah blah blah
You're making me sick, I wish you'd just stop
Showing off for the rest of us that no one wants to love
It's hard enough trying to drink another winter all alone
Love love, kiss kiss, blah blah blah

Well do you find you like to fall in love
With people that you're never gonna meet?
It's easier than breaking up and crying in the street
Do you curse the happy couple, do you cringe at wedding bells?
Do you drink up all the punch while you wish 'em all to hell?

Love love, kiss kiss, blah blah blah
You're making me sick, I wish you'd just stop
Showing off for the rest of us that no one wants to love
It's hard enough trying to drink another winter all alone
Love love, kiss kiss, blah blah blah

You can't escape this fatal case of melancholia
It's in your face, in every place you go, it's stalking you
There are days when we all say we feel we just can't go on
But you've felt this way all along

Love love, kiss kiss, blah blah blah
You're making me sick, I wish you'd just stop
Showing off for the rest of us that no one wants to love
It's hard enough trying to drink another winter all alone
Love love, kiss kiss, blah blah blah
